Rails Boostrap Easy
====================

Rails Bootstrap Easy is a plugin for Ruby on Rails that provides a set of helpers to simplify a work with Bootstrap for RoR developers.

## Installation

Add this row to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'rails_bootstrap_easy'
```

That's all. Now you can start using our helpers. See documentation for detials about configuration, available options and parameters.

**Note**: This gem doesn't provide stylesheets and scripts for Bootstrap. You should add it manually or use some asset-serving engines like [bootstrap-saas](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).
